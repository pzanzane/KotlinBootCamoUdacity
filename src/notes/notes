/* Constructors */
1.  Kotlin can have one primary constructor
2.  Secondary constructor with keywork "constructor", should call to another constructor ultimately leading to primary constructor
    using :this() keyword
3.  Goog Kotlin class should have one constructor with default values, if we are considering have secondary constructor
    we should also consider having helper merthode to create object from constructor with default values.
4.  init{} blocks are blocks which are executed right after primary constructor.
    init blocks can be anywhere in code, properties which we want to access in init blocks should be declared before init blocks
